# Personal Website
### Author: David vanMaanen (david@vanmaanen.us)

This repository contains code for my personal website. Currently, this is just a host for an interactive resume. 

## License

All code, etc. is licensed under the LGPLv3, except where indicated below. A copy of the license is included. If are going to use it though, I do suggest you at least change the text in order to make it useful. Further, if you want your own custom website feel free to contact me and see if I am available for freelance work (availablility varies).
