Currently, I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Program in Neural Computation. My research entailed a creating a mathematical models of neural systems. I then simulate these models using julia, python, and other programming languages in order, in order to make hypothesizes about neural systems. However, I plan to leave academy with a Masters degree. I believe that my strong skills in programming and data analysis coupled with my interest in technology will make me a strong canidate for a variety of positions. "
